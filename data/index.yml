    title1: "Smart Choices, Better Lives",
    text_body1: "Most Americans find themselves spending an awful lot of time in their cars and their homes. So much in fact that it once made great fodder for TV writers imagining fantastical possibilities for both realms. In the 1980s, a fireproof car with the ability to give its driver law-enforcement advice was the fantasy behind one popular prime-time show. Today smart cars are using the latest tech to communicate with drivers, move semi-autonomously and even save lives in the process. In the '60s, a sassy robot-cum-vacuum cleaner was a main character on a classic Saturday morning cartoon. Now, app-enabled smart home technology allows homeowners to do everything from prepare meals to monitor their laundry. No longer sci-fi, forward-looking people who own cars and/or homes are taking a wiser, tech-driven approach to daily living that helps make their lives safer, less expensive and way <span class='last-word'>more stress-free.</span>",

Thanks to advances in both cookware and kitchen appliances, homeowners are not only becoming instant gourmet chefs, but are also helping to prevent accidents and fires as well. Inventions such as skillets built with internal thermometers guide you step by step in your cooking process and alert you to high-heat levels via mobile apps. This way, your cookware can tell you when your food is done or even operate on autopilot and turn itself off — well before any <span class='last-word'>mishaps occur.</sapn>",
